            <p id="sec">A year since the pandemic took a toll on all our lives, we remember those fallen heroes who fought hard to win the war against the pandemic</p>
            <br>
            <p>Early in March 2020, people across the world were running their daily schedules and even planning international trips for the summer. School children were all set to finish their exams and dive into their summer vacation. Unfortunately, on
                this day last year, everything took a turn for the world’s population. The coronavirus had made its way to countries across the world. With the increasing number of positive cases and deaths, country leaders called for complete lockdowns
                in their respective nations. March 25th marks the day of the ‘Janata Curfew’ called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi across India.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Doctors have always played a very important in the development of our society. Furthermore, many doctors have even risked their lives to serve the patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is very important for us convey our gratitude towards
                them.
            </p><br>
            <p>The virus that could <b>spread by physical contact</b> required the entire population to stay within four walls. Meanwhile, with so much uncertainty around what the disease could do, governments across the world tried to curb the fast-spreading
                disease by implementing social distancing and other hygienic practices in public spaces. <br> In India, the situation turned quite dire. Once the lockdown was declared, many corporates laid off their employees. However, a huge population
                of migrant workers and daily wagers had nowhere to go with all transportation facilities shut down and no place of employment. <br> With nothing stopping them, the masses began to travel back to their villages thousands of miles away by
                foot. Police officials were on their toes to curb this situation within the cities and at the outskirts risking their lives to keep the people safe. <br> Meanwhile, another set of heroes worked tirelessly in hospitals as healthcare workers
                battled to control the spread of the virus. But in the fight against this virus, both sections suffered irreparable loss of life. Today, <b>more than 2.75 million</b> have lost the battle against this disease. On the anniversary of the
                lockdown, and we remembers some of these <b>fallen heroes</b>, and we pay our respects to all those who’ve fought hard.</p>

                had received one jab. Preliminary findings, however, show few among them had received full vaccination. A majority also had to receive their first vaccine dose. To date, the IMA data shows that more than 1,500 doctors have died of Covid-19.
